# My Rig

I use a Lenovo Ideapad 330-15IKB. It has an Intel i5-8250U, 8GB Memory, 1TB HDD and a 2GB NVIDIA GeForce MX150. It has dual boot with Manjaro KDE and Windows 10. It serves quite well for daily use and my projects but isn't that good for gaming. But considering its price, it quite good. 

As for peripherals I have a Redgear Gaming Mouse & Mousepad. I use a cheap membrane Keyboard right now but I am planning to get a 60% Mechanical Keyboard in near future.

# My Desktop

I use Arch btw, Manjaro KDE to be specific. It's fast, bloat free (99%) and rolling. I use VSCode with a bunch of extensions and Alacritty with tmux + zsh + ohmyzsh (custom ohmyzsh theme). I use the Dracula theme wherever I can. I am going to make my dotfiles repo soon.

I also have plans to install Arch from scratch once I get some time. I will make a detailed post about how it goes.

# My Server

I have a Raspberry Pi 4B (8GB model) with an external 2TB HDD from Seagate. It runs Ubuntu Server 20.04 and serves as my Home Server + NAS. It hosts an array of services like AdGuardHome, Jellyfin, etc (have a glimpse below).

I will make a detailed post about my Raspberry Pi soon. It will have all details like what I host, what I use etc.
